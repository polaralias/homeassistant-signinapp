# Adopt RKE OKF knowledge format

## Outcome

Durable repository knowledge is represented with portable, plaintext OKF metadata, connected through an RKE-managed relationship graph, and kept distinct from operational Task state and specialised producer-owned schemas.

## Scope

- In scope: type and connect 19 durable knowledge documents; create and validate the bounded `docs/knowledge/` bundle; record this migration as an OKF Task; generate repository-wide HTML and Mermaid views.
- In scope: preserve canonical, evidence, derived, generated, instruction, handoff, fixture, and task boundaries.
- Out of scope: change product behaviour, upgrade support claims, rewrite historical evidence, publish externally, or alter generated/vendor content outside its owning workflow.

## Acceptance

- [x] Classify durable documents and deliberate schema exclusions.
- [x] Add required and recommended plaintext RKE OKF metadata.
- [x] Connect governed knowledge and execution concepts through repository-relative links.
- [x] Preserve reserved indexes and specialised document schemas.
- [x] Classify all 29 in-scope repository Markdown files with zero omissions.
- [x] Remove the redundant repository overview and confirm zero exact duplicate governed knowledge bodies.
- [x] Build and validate the `docs/knowledge/` bundle.
- [x] Validate the OKF Tasks bundle in strict mode.
- [x] Generate repository-wide standalone HTML and scalable Mermaid visualizations with persisted exclusions.
## Dependencies and risks

- The installed `okf-tasks 0.1.0` package is missing its task-body asset; the feature-identical bundled reference CLI is used instead.
- Metadata migration does not upgrade the evidential strength of existing repository claims.
- Existing manual indexes, generated documents, handoffs, fixtures, and skill packages retain their owning formats.

## Related knowledge

- [Documentation map](../../docs/knowledge/documentation-map.md)
- [Repository visualization](../../docs/knowledge/repository-visualization.md)

## Workstreams

- No separately owned workstreams are required.

## Evidence

- RKE bundle validation: conformant (3 concepts, 1 generated index).
- OKF Tasks strict validation: valid (1 task, 0 workstreams, 0 warnings).
- Visualization freshness: standalone HTML and Mermaid outputs match the repository records and persisted exclusion policy.
- Complete Markdown census: 29 in-scope files, 0 unclassified, 0 exact duplicate governed knowledge bodies.
